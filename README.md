# Language-Guided Fine-grained Image Editing
## Intro
Language-guided image editing has grown increasingly popular, largely due to the accessibility of naturallanguage interfaces, as demonstrated by modelslike GPT-4. However, existing approaches often struggle with fine-grained control. 

For example:\
*"Help me remove the guy at the rightmost corner of the image who's wearing a black top and pants"*

The model removes the specified figure, but also changes the central subject's face and alters background semantics.

To address this limitation, we present (1) a zero-shot pipeline and (2) an two-stage pipeline for fine-grained, language-guided image editing. 
## Zero-shot Pipeline
### Method
Given an input image and a natural language prompt (e.g. "replace the dog on the man's lap with a cap"), zero-shot pipeline performs: (1) generate object mask using grounding dino and sam2, (2) dilate the mask for more reasonable output, and (3) inpaint the new object.

### Result

## Two-Stage Pipeline
### Method
Given an input image and a natural language prompt, the two-stage pipeline performs: (1) object mask generation, (2) spatial description via LLaVA, (3) inpainting the background using Stable Diffusion XL, (4) predicting the replacement objectâ€™s mask, and (5) final inpainting to insert the new object.

### Result
*Due to unexpected loss of access to critical GPU resources, we were unable to finish fine-tuning a custom mask generator, so we manually draw a mask as a proof-of-concept.*
